need to be able to write to midi
calc_harmonics to be wrapped inside a pitch detector probably.
calc_average_amplitude outputs something unscaled. Want it to go from 0 to 1
spectral flatness TBI.
calc_average_amplitude needs a high and low parameter so that we can examine portions of the spectrum instead of all at once.
I suspect that the db scaling of fft_mag is slightly off.
